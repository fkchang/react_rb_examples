class ColorList

  # An important part of building a reusable component is being able to pass in other components.
  #
  # Any component that has a block will receive all of the elements (nodes) generated in that block as children.
  # These are accessed through the special "children" param which returns a enumerator.
  #
  # In some cases it is clearer to pass the child as a parameter.  In this case the child is accessed in
  # the normal way by using the named parameter method.
  #
  # The ColorList component demonstrates both ways to pass children to a component.  ColorList takes three
  # parameters - a list of color styles that will be used in sequence when rendering the list, and an optional
  # header and footer that will be rendered before and after the list.
  #
  # Each of the children provided in the block will be displayed in order with a different color taken from the color list.

  def render
    div do
      # sending the render method will place the element into the render buffer

        children.each_with_index do |child, i|
          ul do
            # render will take a param list, and if present will cause the child to be cloned, and the
            # additional params will be shallow merged with any existing params
